## PCA analysis walkthrough

**Preliminary results**

First, PCA analysis was preformed for the data with only necessary filtering to retain maximum coverage.

Short summary of filtering:
- Input file from Aurora: `cardui_migrdiv_indv.vcf.gz`
- Maximum missing % of individuals: 0.3
- Minor allele frequency cutoff fixed to 0.006: which correspond to removing singletons only in dataset of 347 individuals
- Variant depth set to maximum possible: 4 (see justification in Evernote)
